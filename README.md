Alumina is an integrated CAD/CAM, physics simulation, and motion control solution written entirely in Rust.  It is intended to control laser and plasma cutters, 3D printers, CNC routers and mills, and lathes.

Try the [Alumina UI Web Demo](https://timschmidt.github.io/alumina-ui/)

Firmware and UI get linked together at compile time and fit in the onboard flash of a single microcontroller, reducing design complexity, part count, and cost.
 - [Alumina Firmware](https://github.com/timschmidt/alumina-firmware)
   - targets the xtensa and risc-v esp32 microcontrollers
   - sets up a Wifi AP called "Alumina"
   - serves the Alumina UI via HTTP
   - responds to commands from the Alumina UI via HTTP
   - performs motion planning and step generation
   - (planned) port to [embassy](https://embassy.dev/) and [FoA](https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/FoA) and [smol](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/blob/master/examples/simple-server.rs)
   - (planned) port to other embassy hardware targets
 - [Alumina UI](https://github.com/timschmidt/alumina-ui)
   - targets [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly)
   - draws geometry using WebGL and egui
   - works in any browser, desktop or mobile
   - CAD using [csgrs](https://github.com/timschmidt/csgrs) and [egui_node_graph2](https://github.com/trevyn/egui_node_graph2)
   - calculate and display 2D slices of 3D models
   - Communicates with Alumina Firmware to display diagnostic log, graph, and photo of the controller
   - Fits in < 4Mb microcontroller flash, including firmware
   - (planned) multiple controllers in sync
   - (planned) use [wgmath](https://wgmath.rs/) to move most CAD and geometry and toolpath calculation to the GPU

## Development
### Set up toolchain
```shell
cargo install trunk wasm-opt wasm-tools
```

### Run locally
```shell
trunk serve --open --release
```

## Todo
- implement picking for lines and vertices and faces
- single-click for individuals and click-drag for multiples.
- https://github.com/JeroenGar/jagua-rs and/or https://github.com/JeroenGar/sparrow for bin packing
- generate toolpaths from slices
- send toolpaths to firmware
- echo sent / received commands in Diagnostics console
- finish SD card support
- enable persistence via https://docs.rs/eframe/latest/eframe/
- implement tweening for snap view
- ensure font picker in truetype text node works / gets pre-populated
- ensure pin logging works for OUTPUT and INPUT modes and reports apropriately per-pin
- add command stream to architecture graphic
- switch to shift-scroll for zoom, so two-finger scroll can be used for pan in X and Y for mobile
- figure out improper rendering in Chrome Android Pixel 6a
- get UI building for native so that "cargo bloat" can be used
- get long-click as right-click working for Design tab Central view, or add button for opening node menu on mobile
